## About
‚ùó *The game is still in production.*

This game is a typing simulator that not only allows you to improve your blind typing speed skill, but also brings a game element of racing into training. The faster and the more precise you type - the faster your car moves. 
You can choose the difficulty level, which affects the speed of a rival car, as well as the complexity of the words you need to type. If a rival car has overtook you, you have 10 seconds to recover your position.
You can track your statistics in the game - your actual 'words per minute' typing speed, as well as the accuracy of your typing and the time you spend in the game. The speed of your car is linked to your 'adjusted words per minute' typing speed, which means not only the amount of words you type affects the speed, but the accuracy also has an effect on it.

## Details

Typing race presents a kind of an endless runner game:
- the road and environment are generated dynamically
- object pooling is used to reduce performance issues. The initial set is generated at start, and shuffled randomly afterwards
- environment tiles are generated randomly each time so the more variants of tiles were developed the more diverse the game looks

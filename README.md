## About
This is a typing simulator game, in which the speed of your car in the race depends on the speed of your printing. Choose your difficulty level and test your typing speed!
The game is still in production.

## Details

Typing race presents a kind of an endless runner game:
- the road and environment are generated dynamically
- object pooling is used to reduce performance issues. The initial set is generated at start, and shuffled randomly afterwards
- environment tiles are generated randomly each time so the more variants of tiles were developed the more diverse the game looks
